# NormalizationScripts
 Scripts for normalization of Spike-In data

These scripts are designed to facilitate the normalization of ChIP-seq data utilizing exogenous spike-in material. They are currently set up for KMetStat SNAP-ChIP panel and drosophila, but can be adapted to other barcodes or species as needed. In addition, spikeMapCalc will calculate mapping efficiency for concatenated genomes to help determine optimal species choice for spike-in material.
